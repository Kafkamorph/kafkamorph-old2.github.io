A mimosa is half a mosa. A sesquimosa is one mosa [and a half].
If you like mimosas, you might like this beverage thrice as much :-)

Ingredients:

- peach juice (e.g. half a can of Kern's)
- bitter angostura
- lemon juice
- perrier (sparkling water will do)
- gold rum
- cointreau

To get two flutes of Sesquimosa: pour about 6 oz (half a can) of peach juice
in a shaker. Add a dash of angostora, a dash of lemon juice, about 1 oz of
gold rum, 1 oz of cointreau. Shake with ice. Add about 4 oz of perrier or
sparkling water. Enjoy!
