title: “I am a feminist, but…”
---

TL,DR: we all have different perceptions and experiences. Just because
you're fine with a picture, book, movie, etc., doesn't mean that everybody
will accept it equally well. Even if you are the nicest person in the
world. Let's accept it, and be aware of each other sensitivities.


## What am I talking about?

A recent [CommitStrip Episode] describes two guys and a girl watching
an episode of the TV show [Mr Robot]. This TV show has the reputation
of being technically accurate in many ways, which makes it popular
among people who know how modern technology actually works. (Those
people can often be frustrated by the considerable suspension of
disbelief required to watch most movies where computers, networks,
and other technology artifacts are a central point of the plot. Anyway!)

The first image just shows the three characters on a couch, watching the
show. By looking at it, I was already afraid of what would be coming next.
And I was right: they watch the show, with an avalanche of technical
words: DDOS! Rootkits! Boot sequence! And the two guys are totally into
the story, but the girl doesn't get it.

I think that's sexist, and I'm not OK with it.


## Why would that be sexist?

It's conveying the stereotype that women are "not technical," that they
are not interested by computers, and when there is a "geeky" TV show
they won't "get it."

There is indeed a serious problem in the tech industry: there are
[much more men than women], and the unbalance becomes even worse
when you focus on engineering positions. Some people naively think
that this is because men are better than women in tech roles, but
it's simply not true. 
[Every day,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman).
[we use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Pellow)
[inventions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Lerner)
[and concepts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenda_Schroeder)
[created or](http://www.women-inventors.com/Hedy-Lammar.asp)
[pioneered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov)
[by women](http://www.women-inventors.com/Dr-Grace-Murray-Hopper.asp).

Also, things are [getting worse]: the percentage of
women in tech is decreasing, which seems to indicate that we're doing
something [horribly wrong], causing many women to [leave this industry].

There are multiple causes, but [sexism in the tech industry] is one
of them. Sexism isn't always [obvious objectification] of women
or [crass harrassment]. It's also all the little things.

One of the things we do wrong is to perpetuate the stereotype
that women don't understand computers, and that when a bunch of
dudes will talk about technology, the token woman will be the
one who doesn't understand.


## "But I don't find that offensive! And I'm a feminist/a woman!"

Good for you! But other people think differently. Not a few;
a lot, in fact. Because we all have different perceptions.
Maybe you are a woman, working in tech, and you are lucky
enough to be respected by your peers, have never been asked
if you [were a recruiter] at a conference, have never received
[rape and death threats] on IRC and in your emails. Good!

But some (unfortunately, *many*) women in our industry have
a very different experience.

In July 2015, I gave a short talk about the future of the
Cloud, and one thing I said at the end was (short version),
"And I hope that in the future of the Cloud, tech will be a
nicer industry for women." After that talk, some women
in the audience asked me,
"Hey, is it true, that horrible stuff you were
describing? Harrassment, death threats, etc.? It never
happened to me!" But a considerably larger number
of women thanked me for talking about this, and some
of them shared their stories. That's sad, and this has to stop.


## What's the responsibility of a web comic there?

It's a shared responsibility for all of us. Collectively,
we have to make tech welcoming for women. We have to
call out people when they make a [stupid Mother's day joke],
or when they publish a book that will convey the idea
that [girls need boys to fix their computers].

Put it differently: if some day I have a daughter, and if
she's interested into computers, I don't
want her to look at this sexist shit and unconsciously get
the message that only boys understand technology, and that she should
go back to play with her dolls. I want her to look up at
[some of](https://twitter.com/frazelledazzell)
[the badass](https://twitter.com/caitie)
[women out](https://twitter.com/skamille)
[there who](https://twitter.com/rakyll)
[are amzing](https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout)
[role models](https://twitter.com/isisanchalee)
and pursue that path if she wants to, rather than getting
the feeling that she's not welcome in this boy's club.
